make sure you use camel case for variables and methods

We should start creating the Java docs so we don't have to do it all at the end. If you create a method write one for it.

All cards go into an ArrayList.

It also seems like we have a lot of methods that get the cards a player has and checks them.

Player order(who goes first and last, who checks their cards next looking for a card) is determined by the order
in Main._playerArray;

getting a random interger is 
minimum + rn.nextInt(maxValue - minvalue + 1)
