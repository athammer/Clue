This is just a place where I store some obslete code I might want to take snippits of it later.


//		System.out.println("How many players are playing (no more then 6)? ");
//		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in); 
//		int players = scan.nextInt(); //gets quantity of players
//		for(int i = 0; players -1 > i; i++){
//			System.out.println("Enter your player names on at a time."); //each name has to be unique
//			Scanner scan1 = new Scanner(System.in); 
//			String playerName = scan1.nextLine();
//			_currentPlayers.add(playerName); //adding players to hashset
//			Player player = new Player();
//			player.setName(playerName);
//			_playerArray.add(player);
//			
//		}
//		Collections.shuffle(_playerArray); //for now this just shuffles players randomly without a dice roll
//		//add a random number generator to see who goes first
