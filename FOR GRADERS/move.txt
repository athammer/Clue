User Story #5 -- submit details in move.txt
	1.) * Accepts legal movement that stays within the hallway and correctly updates player's location 
		Yup it does this. Click around to prove this.
	2.) * Accepts legal movement that goes through a doorway to end in a room and correctly updates player's location 
		Yup, the way our room works is when you enter a room you can choose which door you want to leave. So if you are in a room you hit
		the door then hit the tile you want to move to right outside the door. If you don't get it just spam click and you'll
		figure it out. It also ends your turn once you enter a room.
	3.) * Accepts legal movement that goes from one room to another via the secret passageway and correctly updates player's location 
		Yes you can either hit the gray button in the corner of the room you are in to tp you to the other corner or click the door in the
		other corner room to move you.
	4.) * Does not let me cheat Does not accept illegal move (if your system lets player try making illegal move, displays error when this happens)
		Error is displayed on the 'console' up above the board as popups are annoying.
