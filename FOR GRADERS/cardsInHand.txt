User Story #4 -- submit details in cardsInHand.txt
	1.) * Shows Miss Scarlet's cards when program starts
		We made it a button so you can see the cards as it was really annoying with the pop ups.
	2.) * Updates card display at start of turn for each player
		It is updated whenever new information is added, but it works correctly. Cards that are found by guesses are added to
		"get all cards" and "get known cards".
	3.) * Each card (not in solution) appears in only one players hand
		Yup works you can check out all the players cards (easiest for two players) and see there is a total of 18(?) cards with 3
		being in the middle as the 'secret' cards.
